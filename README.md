Walking Plant
============
We built robotic extensions for a small plant (e.g., venus fly trap, glowing plant etc...). This bio-machine senses the planting environment and human behaviors around it. It also decides to walks into sunshine or stay away from it. It creates a mysterious illusion of multiple characteristics (i.e., a plant, a robot, or a little friend).
